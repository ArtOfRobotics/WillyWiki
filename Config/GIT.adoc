==== Github synchronisation
A crontab has been created which ensures that Willy stays up-to-date with Github. Because Willy does not have a fixed external-IP or domain, it is unfortunately not possible to use Github Webhooks. That is why a crontab job has been set up, which is configured as follows:

[source,text]
----
sudo crontab -e

*/1 * * * * su -s /bin/sh -c '/home/willy/Documents/WTGD/bin/gitsync.sh ' >> /home/willy/Documents/logs/git.log 2>&1
----

NOTE: Currently this line creates a pull of the test branch, later it is desirable to change this to the master branch for production code.
Logs can be found in:
/home/willy/Documents/logs/
