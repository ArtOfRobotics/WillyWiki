== Findings
=== Indoor navigation

=== Offline Speech recognition

=== GPS
The only thing that has been realized so far with regard to indoor navigation contains GPS. GPS coordinates can be received inside ROS when subscribed on the /GPS topic.

=== Access point without router
The physical router can be removed. A second external networkcard can be used to setup the AP and the internal network card can be used to connect with eduroam. However only one default gateway is advisable and using two connections at the same times, performance, flexiblitiy and stalibility are reduced.

Conclusion; Don't remove the router.
