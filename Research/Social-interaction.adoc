==== Preface
One of Willy's goals is to make people aware of the problems and harmfulness that waste entails. Interaction will be the primary method to fulfill this goal. Interaction between humans and robots can be realized with different technologies and with different strategies.  

==== Willy to Person
This chapter contains possibilities for Willy to communicate to persons around him.

===== Initiation of communication
Before Willy is able to communicate with humans. Willy is required to recognize humans. This can be achieved with different techniques. 

====== Object recognition
???

====== cob_people_detection
ROS contains several packages for detecting and identifying faces, and detecting and tracking humans with RGB-D sensors or laser scanners. Detects persons through head and face detection and identifies the detected faces. The results are tracked over time to increase confidence. The system is optimized to be used with a Microsoft Kinect or Asus Xtion Pro Live sensor but could also handle different sensors as long as depth and color images are provided.

* Advantage: Cob_people_detection can detect and identifying faces. To start a conversation, Willy can for example require to detect a face for a minimum amount of time. No user input is required.

* Disadvantage: The use of this method requires an extra kinect, because the current kinect will be used for navigation and will be located incorrect for people detection. 

====== Waiting for physical input
Willy can draw attention by using his screen. Before he starting a conversation, Willy waits for physical user input from an end user. User input can be a accomplished by using the Lead motion or one of the alternative interaction methods. 

* Advantage: Don't require any extra hardware. There is no extra algorithm required that defines when the attention of a passerby is drawn or not.Last but not least, this method is less error prone

* Disadvantage: This method required the user to (physical) interact with Willy before an conversation is started. 

===== Means of communication

====== Speech
====== Text
====== Visuals

===== Content of communication
Starting a conversation can be done by using different communication-techniques. 

====== Questioning
Willy can ask questions to start a conversation. If the question is answered, Willy can react based on an algorithm. Because the answer depends on the reaction, this method is harder to achieve. However the attention of the person will be drawn more quickly because of the subject of the answer based on the input. 

====== Informing


==== Person to Willy
This chapter contains possibilities for a person to communicate to Willy.

===== Means of communication

====== Object detection
If a person starts to communicate with Willy, Willy should be able to detect there
is a person in front of the robot. One of the possibilities is Willy using its sonar 
sensors to detect a person.

Better is using the Kinect to detect a person. By using the Kinect it is
possible to determine wether the object in front of Willy is a person or an other object.

====== Voice recognition
To make a person be able to communicate with Willy, the robot should be able to listen to
the person by recognizing his or her speech. A good microphone is neccesary for listening to 
sounds and filtering out background noise. An API can be used to convert speech to text.
Voice recognition is a great way to create user interaction, but can be risky if there is
a lot of background noise.

====== Touchscreen
Another way to get user input is a touchscreen. This makes it possible to have buttons and
clickable areas. A touchscreen is a good way to create clear user interaction. A touchscreen is
however heavy and expensive. Another difficulty is the fact that it is hard to make a touchscreen
waterproof and have good responsiveness at the same time. An alternative for a trouchscreen
is a normal screen with al LEAP-sensor in front of it. This is cheaper, lighter and gives more
possibilities.

====== Gesture recognition
By using a LEAP-sensor (see previous paragraph) it is also possible to recognize gestures.
The different gestures can be showed or explained on the touchscreen. This is also possible
with the Kinect, but with somewhat less possibilities.

==== Speech Bot
To process the incoming speech and create answers for that, Willy should have a speech bot.
(Not done yet)

==== Recommendations
This chapter contains recommendations for the best appliances in communication with Willy.
