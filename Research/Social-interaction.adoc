==== Preface
One of Willy's goals is to make people aware of the problems and harmfulness that waste entails. Interaction will be the primary method to fulfill this goal. Interaction between humans and robots can be realized with different technologies and with different strategies.  

==== Willy to Person
This chapter contains possibilities for Willy to communicate to persons around him.

===== Initiation of communication
Before Willy is able to communicate with humans. Willy is required to recognize humans. This can be achieved with different techniques. 

====== Object recognition
object recognition will be recognize objects

====== cob_people_detection
ROS contains several packages for detecting and identifying faces, and detecting and tracking humans with RGB-D sensors or laser scanners. Detects persons through head and face detection and identifies the detected faces. The results are tracked over time to increase confidence. The system is optimized to be used with a Microsoft Kinect or Asus Xtion Pro Live sensor but could also handle different sensors as long as depth and color images are provided.

===== Means of communication

====== Speech
====== Text
====== Visuals

===== Content of communication

====== Questioning
====== Informing


==== Person to Willy
This chapter contains possibilities for a person to communicate to Willy.

===== Means of communication

====== Object detection
If a person starts to communicate with Willy, Willy should be able to detect there
is a person in front of the robot. One of the possibilities is Willy using its sonar 
sensors to detect a person.

Better is using the Kinect to detect a person. By using the Kinect it is
possible to determine wether the object in front of Willy is a person or an other object.

====== Voice recognition
To make a person be able to communicate with Willy, the robot should be able to listen to
the person by recognizing his or her speech. A good microphone is neccesary for listening to 
sounds and filtering out background noise. An API can be used to convert speech to text.
Voice recognition is a great way to create user interaction, but can be risky if there is
a lot of background noise.

====== Touchscreen
Another way to get user input is a touchscreen. This makes it possible to have buttons and
clickable areas. A touchscreen is a good way to create clear user interaction.

====== Gesture recognition

==== Speech Bot

==== Recommendations
This chapter contains recommendations for the best appliances in communication with Willy.
