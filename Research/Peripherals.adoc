==== Preface
This document is used to determine which batteries we need to have for
Willy. It contains the calculations of the maximum energy consumption of
Willy the garbage robot and the needed battery capacity. The dimensions
in which the batteries should fit are also mentioned in chapter three.
The final chapter is our advice to Art of Robotics for which batteries
we should get for Willy.

==== Capacity
This chapter is about the energy use of Willy the garbage robot. To know
how much capacity the batteries need it is needed to know which parts
use energy and how much they use.

====== Energy consumption

There are several parts in Willy which use power to function. In the
table below are the parts and their maximum energy consumption as well
as the calculations to determine the maximum used power in total.

|Screen |1 |19.5 |3 |60 |60

| | | | | |

|Total: | | | | |1424.65
|=======================================================================

====== Battery capacity

The capacity of the batteries for the robot is depending on the time
that Willy should drive. We estimated that it would be nice that Willy
could drive for 6 hours before it needs to charge.

If the power consumption of the robot is 1424.65 Watt, it is 1424.65
Watt/24V = 59.36 Ah. The current batteries are 60Ah each. This means
that if we want to use Willy for at least 6 hours, we need 6 batteries
of 60Ah with a total of 360Ah.

==== Dimensions

There are several options for fitting the needed capacity in Willy. One
of them is six batteries of 60Ah of which we could fit four in the
rear-part of the frame and two in the box which is used for the current
batteries. The battery bracket is 418*180mm. Most of the batteries for
sale are at least 230*170mm so the only way two batteries will fit in
one tray is to turn them 90 degrees. Even then the bracket of the frame
must move about 50 millimetres to the front of the robot. The problem
with this solution is that there will be no room for another set of two
batteries unless we remove the current battery case. With that in mind
the drawing underneath is made. The bracket is deleted and the current
battery case has been removed. This way the six batteries of 60Ah each
could fit inside the frame.

Another option is to use 180Ah batteries which are larger but only two
batteries are needed. The bracket in the frame must be (re)moved because
of the 180Ah batteries being at least 500mm in length. When laying these
down there is room for two batteries next to each other.

image:media/batteries_2.jpg[image,width=604,height=339]

==== Advice

Both options are possible for Willy. Our preferred option is to go with
six 60Ah batteries, because with six smaller batteries the layout of the
design is more flexible. There is a possibility that the design changes
and for that flexibility is important. Another reason to use the six
batteries is that these could be placed lower under the frame. Our
advice is to keep the batteries as low as possible in the frame because
the centre of gravity is lower which increases stability during driving.

==== Preface

This document is about the research of the possibility to get a new
screen on Willy. The reason for a new screen is that the current screen
is a screen that uses 130 Watt. The last project group noticed that the
batterie level drained fast when using the screen.

==== Current screen

The current screen is a Smit Visual Touch LCD panel with the following
specifications:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=============================================
|*Brand* |*Smit Visual*
|*Type* |Focus Touch LCD monitor 42”
|*Touch* |Yes
|*Response time* |6,5 milliseconds
|*Brightness* |500 cd/m2
|*Resolution* |1920 * 1080 pixels
|*DVI* |1
|*Power usage* |130W
|*Backlight* |LCD
|*Length / Width / Height* |104,5/63,5/14 (cm)
|=============================================

A problem with this screen is that it runs on 230V. It needs a converter
to supply the necessary voltage. The converter has an efficiency of
roughly 60%. The actual power which is used to use the screen is 130W *
1.4 = 182W.

==== New screen

A new screen has to be more efficient than the current screen. Because
of that it’s wise to look at a LED screen which uses an adapter. With
this we exclude the 230V converter and the power usage of the screen
decreases dramatically.

When Willy uses a LED screen of 42 inch without the converter, it uses
roughly 60 watt. This means we use 32% of the current used energy.

Willy needs a way to interact with people and for that the current
screen uses touch. There will be a research about other ways to interact
with people. Because of this the next screen doesn’t have to be a
touchscreen. This makes the screen more affordable.

One of the possibilities is the LG-43LJ5150. This is a 43 inch screen
with the following specifications:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===============================================
|*Brand* |*LG*
|*Type* |43LJ5150
|*Touch* |No
|*Resolution* |1920 * 1080 pixels
|*Connection* |HDMI 2x, USB
|*Power usage* |42W
|*Backlight* |Direct-LED
|*Length / Width / Height* |110,8/65,7/6,95 (cm)
|===============================================

This tv needs the converter. The total power consumption will be 42W*1.4
=58,8W.

==== Advice

The advice is to look for a second hand 42 inch tv screen without touch.
These are affordable and use a lot less energy than the current screen.
It would be handy to use a tv which uses a power adapter so Willy don’t
has to use the external converter. Even if there is a new screen, like
the one stated in chapter three, the power consumption decreases by more
than 60%.

==== Preface

The primary interaction method to communicate with ‘Willy’ will be by
voice recognition. When voice recognition is not available an second
communication method is required. Voice recognition may not work well in
a noisy environment. With a second communication method, ‘Willy’ is also
able to communicate to people with speech or hearing problems. In this
document, possible solutions will be researched.

==== Leap motion sensor


The leap motion sensor is a 3D motion and gesture controller. The device
contains three infrared LEDs and two infrared cameras. The cameras catch
the reflection of the infrared LEDs at a rate of 200 frames per second.
(Leap Motion, sd) The Leap Motion sensor has an accuracy of 0.7mm.
(Frank Weichert, 2013)

Figure 1: Leap Motion Controller

The Leap Motion could be useful as an alternative for the touchscreen.
Gestures and motion can be detected and with this Willy can be
controlled. The Leap motion is usable without installation.

==== Kinect Sensor


The Kinect V1 is a device which contains an infrared emitter, an
infrared Depth sensor, a color sensor, four microphones and a 3-Axis
accelerometer. (Microsoft, sd) Infrared is used to measure distances to
objects. In combination with the color sensor it creates a RGB image
with depth.

v1,width=600,height=300]

Figure 2: Kinect v1 Sensor

The four microphones can detect sound and even the location of the sound
source and its direction. The 3-Axis accelerometer is used to determine
the orientation of the Kinect sensor.

For interaction Willy could use a Kinect to look for gestures for
controlling Willy.

The benefit of using a Kinect V1 is that it is widely used with other
robots. Because of this Willy could use the Kinect for mapping and
localization as well as secondary interaction with the screen. The
mapping while driving and the interaction when Willy is stationary.

==== Touch screen

A touch screen can be used for controlling Willy. The current screen
Willy uses is a touchscreen but uses way too much power. There are
options which have touch included and use les power, but these are
expensive.

Another option is a bracket which can be applied to a non-touchscreen to
make it touch-sensitive. With this option Willy could use every display
that is on the market with only the added bracket for touch.

image:media/AlternativeInteraction4.jpeg[Afbeeldingsresultaat voor infrared touch
frame,width=302,height=251]

Figure 3: Infrared Touch Frame

These touch frames work with infrared to measure the distance to for
example a finger and uses this for its touch input. The touch frame is
connected using USB and works plug and play with only the need of
calibration.

==== Touch pad

A touchpad like a laptops touchpad is the easiest and cheapest way to
communicate with Willy. There are versions with a keyboard and mouse in
it. These versions can do everything what an ordinary mouse and keyboard
could do.

==== Conclusion

The Leap motion is a medium prized alternative for interaction with
Willy. It is easy to understand and can be used without practice.
Because of its fast measurements the Leap is reliable to use as a second
interaction method.

The Kinect V1 is cheap to buy and is already used in other robots for
gesture recognition. A disadvantage of the Kinect is that it requires a
lot of performance from the mini-pc.

The touchscreen or touchscreen infrared frame is an option for precise
tracking of multiple fingers. They are however more expensive than the
other options.

The touchpad is the easiest and most affordable option of them all.
Everyone knows how to use it and it is reliable. It works without
installation when plugged in the USB-port of the mini-pc. Another
benefit is that the touchpad uses the least power of all other options.

The advise is to use a touchpad at this state of the project. Because
this project is all about prototyping, a cheap and reliable alternative
might be the best idea.
