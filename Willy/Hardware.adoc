=== Components
This chapter contains all the components with explanation.

==== Mini pc
This is the dedicated PC for running the ROS Server. Al the calculational 
work will be done on this PC. Therefore, we chose for a PC with some 
calculation power as well as enough RAM.

==== Motors and controller
Willy contains 2 motors from a second-hand mobility scooter. A previous 
project group has chosen this option as documented in the ‘Ontwerp verslag’.
(Ontwerpverslag, 2016)

These motors need 24 volts and use a max of 20 amps. One of the previous project
groups created the motor controller to control the motors. This is
documented in the ‘Systeem dossier’ from a previous project group.
(Systeem Dossier, 2016)

This motor controller is made by using an Arduino Mega and a custom
shield with additional custom hardware. This hardware makes sure the
data from the wheel encoders are sent to the proper digital pins on the
Arduino board. The motor controller processes the data and sends it to
the ROS framework. This data is then processed by the WillyController,
which is running as a node on the ROS framework.

The current to the motors is also controlled by this Arduino.

The motor controller is built as shown below:

image:../Archive/2018S1/Research/media/current-status/image5.jpg[image]

The 3 cables to the internal motor controller (built in in the wheelchair 
frame) are connected to the original cable with a simple circuit. The pinout 
of the connector attached to the cable is as follows:

image:media/overview/connector.png[image]

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===============================================
|Pin number |Description |Internal Cable Color
|1 |{plus} 24V | Red 
|2 |- 0V | Black
|3 |Driving data |White
|4 |Unknown (not used) |Yellow
|5 |Enable | Blue
|6 |Actuator Data (not used) |Green
|===============================================

The drive data pin (3) is used to send driving commands to the internal 
controller. The yellow cable is not used and the function is unknown.
The enable pin is connected to the emergency button and the switch on 
the motor controller. The motors only work when the voltage level on this 
cable is 5 volts. The actuator pin is not used in this project. In the 
original wheelchair this pin is used for the lighting etc.

NOTE: The motor controller also contains a connection for charging the 
batteries. The connector at the side of the box is connected to the {plus} 
and - of the cable to the internal motor controller.

===== Brakes

The two engines of willy contain both a brake. This brake is controlled
by the engine itself. When the active signal to the motors is lost, the
motor will automatically activate the brake. To start the driving_willy
project, you NEED to deploy the brakes. Otherwise Willy will not drive!

image:../Archive/2018S1/Research/media/current-status/image7.png[alt=image7,width=300,height=400]

Make sure to deploy the brakes. Otherwise Willy won’t work!! There is
only one way to detect if the brakes are deployed. It’s by simply
testing if the wheel can't turn (Or a very little bit) anymore. 

IMPORTANT: The wheels should not be able to turn for Willy to function 
normally. The brakes will automatically be released by Willy when driving.

==== Batteries

===== Old situation
In the old situation Willy contained 2 12V batteries connected in serial,
adding up to 24V. Both batteries are 52Ah.

===== New situation
In the new situation the 2 batteries are replaced with 6 new 12V batteries.
All the batteries are 60Ah. They are connected placing 2 batteries in serial
3 times in parallel. This adds again up to 24V.

image:media/technical/batteries_new.png[image]

image:media/technical/battery_new.png[image]

==== Power Supply
The 19 volts for the mini-pc and the screen is provided by a step-down converter.
The module is based on the Xl4015 buch DC to DC converter. The input voltage
range is 8-36V and the adjustable output range is 1.25V to 32V. The converter
is rated for a max current of 5 amps.

===== Fuse
Between the batteries and the step-down converter, there is a fuse placed. 
The fuse called T5L250V is rated for 250V with 5A.

==== Sonars
To prevent collisions, ultrasonic sensors are used. These sensors
measure distance by using sound. This is made possible by sending out
bursts of high frequency noise, and then waiting for a reflection of
that sound using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. 

image:../Archive/2018S1/Research/media/current-status/image8.jpeg[image]

By using this data Willy is be able to decide if he is able to drive any
further in a certain direction. In the event of Willy being not able to
drive any further, he will decide if there is a direction where he is
able to drive further. This way Willy will be able to drive around
autonomously without collisions. How Willy reacts to objects in his
navigation is researched by a previous group. (Navigation design v0.1,
2017)

The datasheet <<1>> for the HC-SR04 is included in the sources at the bottom 
of this document.

The sensors all use 5V as can be seen in the schematic:

image:media/technical/Sensors_schematic_updated.jpg[image]

As shown in the schematic above, all the 16 sensors are connected to the
Arduino.

The sensors are connected in the following order:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===============================================
|Arduino Digital Pin Number |Sonar Sensor Number
|3 |Sensor 0
|4 |Sensor 1
|5 |Sensor 2
|6 |Sensor 3
|7 |Sensor 4
|8 |Sensor 5
|9 |Sensor 6
|10 |Sensor 7
|11 |Sensor 8
|12 |Sensor 9
|13 |Sensor 10
|A0 |Sensor 11
|A1 |Sensor 12
|A2 |Sensor 13
|A3 |Sensor 14
|A4 |Sensor 15
|===============================================

The sensors are placed as follows:

image:../Archive/2018S1/Research/media/current-status/image10_3.jpg[image]

It should be noted that not all the sensor are read at the same time. 
All odd numbered sensors are read first, and after a small delay the 
even numbered sensors are read. This is because sensors placed next to
each other can interfere the readings of each other.

==== GPS / Compass
IMPORTANT: The GPS and compass are currently implemented but not used in 
the code on the mini-pc.

To allow Willy to drive outdoor by using a precomputed route, a GPS
sensor and a compass are required. The GPS sensor is linked to the
WillyController using ROS. In WillyController the raw data is processed
to usable coordinates. These coordinates are only used to draw a line
where Willy has driven in the code of the previous group.
The Compass is used to determinate the direction of willy. This is
needed for navigation when willy is going to drive precomputed routes.

The sensors are connected according to the following scheme:

image:../Archive/2018S1/Research/media/current-status/image12.jpg[image]

As can be seen in the scheme, there are two Arduino’s used to measure
sensor data. Both Arduino’s are connected with I2C (see pins A4 and A5).
The second Arduino with the GPS sensor is powered with the 5V pin from
the first Arduino. At the moment of writing this has not been fixed and
reduced to one Arduino.

==== Screen
The screen used is a KDL-42W815B <<2>> from Sony. The screen is connected to 
the mini-pc with a VGA cable. The manual can be found at the bottom of 
this document.

NOTE: The current screen is a replacement of the old screen. This 
screen was very heavy and energy consuming.

==== LIDAR
The previous group has also done research on a Lidar sensor.
Unfortunately the previous documentation stated that it was not possible
to link a Lidar to ROS. Also other methods where somehow researched by a
previous group but not in the form of a Lidar. (Research localization
system v1.1, 2017)

A LIDAR sensor uses a laser to measure distance. With these measurements
the sensor makes a map of all the objects in the environment.

image:../Archive/2018S1/Research/media/current-status/image13.jpeg[image]

The previous group has done some research concerning LIDAR and the link to 
ROS. But came to the conclusion that it is not possible to create a link 
between LIDAR and ROS. Therefore they decided to not implement the LIDAR 
sensor.

After doing some research we found that it is possible and supported to
link ROS to a LIDAR sensor.

At this stage we use the LIDAR to navigate with Willy. The sensor is 
placed at the front of the robot.

The LIDAR is connected with a ethernet connection to the pc.

==== Kinect
image:../Archive/2018S1/Research/media/current-status/image11.png[image]

As a method to navigate inside, initially the Kinect was chosen. This is 
not true anymore. The Kinect is now used to detect if there is a person 
in front of Willy. A Kinect can create a framework of a person and see 
all movements of that person. By adding a Kinect to willy, willy will 
be able to recognize people and interact with them by using the speech 
recognition of the Kinect.

There are two versions of the Microsoft Kinect: Kinect 1 for Xbox 360
and Kinect 2 for Xbox one. See table 1 which list all the different
features of both versions.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|======================================================
|Feature |Kinect 1 |Kinect 2
|Color Camera |640 x 480 @30 fps |1920 x 1080 @30 fps
|Depth Camera |320 x 240 |512 x 424
|Max Depth Distance |apr. 4.5 m |8 m
|Min Depth Distance |40 cm in near mode |50 cm
|Depth Horizontal Field of View |57 degrees |70 degrees
|Depth Vertical Field of View |43 degrees |60 degrees
|Tilt Motor |Yes |no
|Skeleton Joints Defined |20 joints |25 joints
|Full Skeletons Tracked |2 |6
|USB Standard |2.0 |3.0
|======================================================

The main difference which is most important for us is the Field of View
(FoV). The bigger the FoV, the more Willy can see in front of him. The
Kinect 2 can also recognize more people and can see further away, which
are both nice features to have when the social aspect of Willy will be
implemented in the future. This makes the Kinect 2 more futureproof than
its precursor. (Kinect 1 vs 2 specifications: , sd) (Kinect 1
specifications, sd) (Main factors/features of most industrial computer
vision hardware., sd)

The Kinect used in Willy is a version 1 Kinect, the old one.
