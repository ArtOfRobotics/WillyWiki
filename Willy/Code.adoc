==== Overview

Our driving willy code consists of modulair components named controllers. 
These controllers controls the functionality of willy. Every piece of hardware
has it's own controller which controls the methods and stores the variables.
A global class diagram can be found in the image above.

By using this way of coding, functionality of willy can be easily extended.
Just create a new controller and add your methods to it.
A detailed explaination of this can be found in the "Extending functionality" 
paragraph on this page below.

==== Controller setup

Every controller is created and declared in the main. The main creates the class object 
and returns a pointer to it.

This pointer is forwarded to the subcontroller of willy
named "DrivingController".

In this class the subcontrollers are declared.
The current subcontrollers of willy are:

1. VisionController
2. GeneralController
3. VisionController

The pointers of the controllers are forwarded to the subcontrollers above in the "DrivingController"

Now every controller has acces to their subscontroller and the subcontroller has acces to the main where the other controllers are declared.
By using this method we can always access all data and methods of the controllers and subcontrollers.
