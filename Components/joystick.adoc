=== Prerequisites
The Docker container requires the device */dev/input/js0* to be connected to the host. In most cases a knockoff PS3 controller or Xbox controller wil do the trick. The controller requires to have _select_ button to be pressed when controlling Willy with the right analog stick. This component uses the default settings for teleop twist joy package, which may require a bit practice to maneuver through the building.
