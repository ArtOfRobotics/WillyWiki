==== Preface

1.  Chapter

This document is about the Definition of Done. It describes when an item
in the backlog is finished and what is necessary for finishing it. For
each type of item there are several specific rules and tasks.

The rules and tasks support handling this project with a high quality
standard. It helps making Willy safe to use and well documented.
