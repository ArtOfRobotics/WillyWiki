Preface
-------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

‘Willy the garbage disposal robot’, further revered to as Willy, is a
project initiated by ‘The Art of Robotics’, a foundation located in
Zwolle which goal is to promote awareness regarding the increasing
influence of robotics in everyday life. Ruud van der Burg is the
initiator of the foundation and is our contact person during the
project.

Disclaimer
~~~~~~~~~~

Previous project groups have already been working on Willy. For this
reason, it would be unnecessary to rewrite previously written documents.
Most parts of the previous documentation are incorporated and are
modified accordingly.

Goal
~~~~

The goal of Willy is to clean for example the market square of Zwolle
and create awareness of waste by communicating with people. Willy is
able to communicate/interact in a basic manner with people in its direct
surroundings.

Goal of the client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Progress of Willy is important because it needs to fulfill the goals
below. Other methods can be used to fulfill this Goals. However, the
parties involved prefer Willy as a mean. The main goals are:

* Promote awareness regarding the increasing influence of robotics in
everyday life
* Clean the market square of Zwolle
* Make people environmentally conscious
* Promote ‘The art of robotics’
* Promote Windesheim Winnovation

Current status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Willy is designed and assembled during multiple iterations. The first
iterations mainly focused on designing and building the software and
hardware foundations for Willy.

Features
^^^^^^^^

At the time of writing Willy has the following features:

* Frame & design
* Driving
* GPS
* Remote control & monitoring (web-platform)
* ROS framework
* Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance
* Display with touchscreen
* Basic speech
* Odometry sensors

Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All of the above mentioned features are implemented in Willy but differ
in how well it works. Because of this the following list is a broad
summary of how it works based on a comprehensive inventory. (Inventory
Current status of Willy, 2018)

Autonomous driving
++++++++++++++++++

Willy is only able to avoid obstacles with the current sensors and
decide which way he is able to move. Because Willy is not aware of his
location in a room it is not able to fully drive autonomously as
described in the next paragraph.

Location
++++++++

Willy is only capable of calculating the distance traveled by using
odometry which are sensors registering the number of turns each wheel
makes. Willy is equipped with ultrasonic distance sensors, these are
used to prevent collision with obstacles. Both sensors combined do not
provide information about Willy’s current location.

Willy is only able to track its position outside using GPS but it is not
yet used to navigate.

Frame & design
++++++++++++++

Willy is designed by one of the previous groups who worked on Willy, but
this design is partly outdated. Also the current frame does not exactly
match the designed works.

Display
+++++++

The current display in use is drawing too much power to let Willy drive
for a longer period of time. This is also because a previous group had
to add a screen to Willy in a hurry.

Remote control & monitoring
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Willy can be remote controlled and monitored, however we found that this
is not reliable yet and the controlling of Willy is very sensitive.

Basic speech
++++++++++++

Willy uses a chatbot to communicate with people, however we found that
this works at a minimum because most of the chatbot responses do not
make sense or not understandable. Also there is no substation or
documentation found regarding the chatbot functionality.

The proposal of the client
--------------------------

Meetings
~~~~~~~~

The client told us in our meetings that new functionality was desirable.
However, we found out that the current functionality’s were not working
as expected, documentation is lacking crucial information and design
choices are not substantiated.

This lead to our main goal being to improve, stabilize and document
current functionality. And while realizing a reliable and well
documented robot, we research new features to implement in the future.
Other students can work on a well-documented project what makes
transferability easy leading to future project groups being familiar
with Willy in a relative short period of time.

We expect that there will be plenty of time to add new features. In the
next paragraph these improvements are discussed.

Pathfinding
^^^^^^^^^^^

A new feature necessity is pathfinding which means that the robot can
autonomously choose the path to a certain position or find his way in a
given area.

Bug fixing (improve functionality)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current functionalities do not work consistent and contains bugs.
Improving functionality is very important to stabilize a good basis
before adding new functionalities.

Inside location monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current state of Willy allows for location monitoring outside with
GPS. But GPS is only reliable outdoors and depending on the environment.
Another technology is necessary to realize indoor location tracking and
improve accuracy.

Analyze/improve battery life
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is not clear how long the current battery last without any power
supply. Investigating the current battery life and possibly improving
the battery life is necessary to make Willy work independently.

Development environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Split environments testing and production, easy keep willy running on
the latest possible version.

Human interaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Human interaction by the use of a microphone is another new
functionality the client would like to see as part of Willy. This can be
realized by the use of a ‘Kinect link’, which is partly investigated by
previous groups, but not completed.

Design
^^^^^^

Previous groups have worked on a design for Willy, but the design is
partly outdated and needs an update. A more detailed design is also
needed to plan where each component is going to be placed.

Plan of action
--------------

In this section we will explain how we will approach the project, which
methods are used, our agreements and the defined scope.

Scope
~~~~~

To define our project scope the goal of the project is used as a base,
we visualized this using a word map of tasks we could do during the
project and which tasks are excluded.

Goal
^^^^

Our main goal is to improve, stabilize and document current
functionality. And during this new functionalities are researched. The
importance of implementation of new features will be emphasized, as new
features can only be added on top of a functioning and stable bases.

When finishing our goal described in the above paragraph, new
functionality will be implemented by priority of the client. The main
goal of willy and personal learning goals will be decisive factors.

Inclusion
^^^^^^^^^

Stabilize and improving ‘Willy’ is our main priority. Based on the
inventory, improvements will be made on functionality, documentation,
usability, transferability and reliability of ‘Willy’. After finishing
this, research documentation will be realized where new functionalities
are compared. Assuming there is some time left, new functionality will
be realized based on our advice, client input and prioritization as
stated in the previous paragraph.

Exclusion
^^^^^^^^^

The realization of the final product of Willy is not achievable with the
current time and budget.

Figure 1: Visualisation of the scope

Agreements
~~~~~~~~~~

Agreements in our team
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following agreements where made between the project members. The
agreements clarify attendance, deadlines, tasks and responsibilities
within the project group.

* Every team member is responsible to actively support the scrum working
method and keep the tools used for scrum up to date.
* Absence is shared within our Google Calendar
* Documentation is shared using Google Drive
* Every group member is present at the innovation lab at set times
* Communication outside working hours is done by using WhatsApp

Agreements with the client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make communication efficient and pleasant for both our project group
and the client the following agreements where made between our team and
the client.

* The client is informed by the progress of each sprint by receiving
weekly reporting from the project group
* Communication takes place using E-mail or by phone
* Required material can be requested, the client will try to recruit
sponsors if the material is outside his budget
1.  Methods
~~~~~~~

3.3.1 Scrum
^^^^^^^^^^^

For this project our team is going to use scrum as a way to manage tasks
to complete the project and reach the goal. Scrum is one of the most
used method for implementing an agile workflow.

Tools
+++++

The tool we use to implement scrum is Trello, here we maintain the
product backlog, sprint backlog and the current progress, review and
done lists. To implement scrum during the sprint we use daily standups
where we keep each other posted on what task where working on, what
problems we face and expect to face, and what our plan is for the day.
We also use retrospectives in different formats where we give each other
feedback and look back on the completed sprint. Lastly, we use sprint
reviews to present what has been completed and show the client the
current progress after that we discuss what to do next in so called the
sprint planning.

Roles
+++++

To use scrum there are a number of required roles to guide the project.

Product owner

The product owner builds and manages the product backlog, provides
priorities and set goals for the sprint. In this project the tasks of
the product owner are somewhat divided and are managed by the whole
team. The backlog items are prioritized by our client, but further
managed by the team. The reason for this is because the client does not
have time available to be present at the sprint planning, sprint reviews
or discuss item specific needs. Therefore we will keep in contact with
the client and provide weekly status reports of our progress and discuss
specifics if needed during the project.

Scrum master

The scrum master is there to coach the team and protect the team from
widening the scope when the client for example requests extra features
during the sprint. Another task is to keep improving the team and help
to optimize the delivery flow.

The Team

The team contains members with different skill set and work together to
deliver each sprint. The team is self-organizing and does not require a
project leader. Each team member helps each other to ensure a successful
sprint completion.

Definition of Done
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The definition of done is an important piece of scrum’s puzzle, it
defines rules for what is considered done. These rules come down to the
following main points:

* The result complies to the predetermined acceptance criteria
* The result is well documented
* The result is at least checked by another team member
* The result is conformed the written guidelines and rules
* The result is tested

The complete definition of done and corresponding rules and guidelines
are found in the appendixes.

Risk analyses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the table below, possible risks are discussed that applies to our
group of students. the table shows the possible risks and the
corresponding countermeasures to migrate the risk

Note: Other project documentation can consist of a risk analyses
concerning Willy. The risk analyses below describes the project risks
concerning the students.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Risk |Countermeasure
|The five HBO-I qualities are not represented or in insufficient level
|Before setting objectives, first think in which way the HBO-I qualities
will be accountable.

|Objectives are not achieved |By using scrum, a maximum period of time
will be designated to a specific goal. If the goal is not achieved, the
next sprint will cover a different approach.

|Agreements are not fulfilled by one or more group members |By using a
clear planning in combination with weekly standups, progress is
monitored

|Cumbersome methods and solutions are used. |By investigating the
working method and solutions, a real and well-founded advice can be
issued to the client.

|There is not enough knowledge in the project group a|
By doing research before implementing new functionality, knowledge will
be available and documented.

Windesheim has some experienced employees and our client also has some
very useful connections. After doing some research about a specific
subject, these persons can be contacted.

|The project is terminated by the product owner |The importance of the
project was submitted by our project group to the stakeholders who make
the project available. These stakeholders are positive about the
project.

|There is not enough time to finish the project goal |A realistic client
proposal and scope is defined in the plan of action.

|The absence of team members |Every team member has responsibility for
delivering a contribution, by using scrum minimal decencies are created
between the group.
|=======================================================================

Even though Ruud is an experienced Robotics project manager, he is not
truly able to guide us in a technical sense. This means that we have to
make most technical decisions on our own backed by research. On the one
hand, this provides us with a great amount of freedom. On the other
hand, this means that we are highly responsible for the choices we make.

Quality management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This chapter describes the quality management strategy. The quality
management strategy is described to guarantee the quality of each
product which will be delivered during the project.

Group effort control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The quality of the content is guaranteed by discussing expectations
about the product beforehand with the project team. Each team member
will review documentation, code or other product. During the review of a
specific product, the reviewer will make comments based on his
interpretation of the definition of done. This will lead to a similar
vision and content.

Sprint review
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the end of each sprint the different delivered products are reviewed.
Not just the quality but also the built and how they fit into the rest
of the project. With this information we can learn from any mistakes we
made. There is however another reason to do a sprint review. That reason
is to inform our product owner of the progress we made.

Definition of Done
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The link:#definition-of-done[Definition of Done] is a ruleset that
defines when an item is done. This includes acceptance criteria which
are determined during the sprint planning by the team. This also
includes the quality and what has to be completed.

Apart from acceptance criteria the definition of done also implies that
everything complies to rules and guidelines specifically defined for
each category of components. The definition of done also states that a
test plan has been created and is tested following this plan. In the
next paragraph the use of a test plan is further explained.

To guarantee quality we made a strict and detailed definition of done
where all the rules and guidelines are included. This way we can make
sure that our deliverables comply to our quality guidelines.

The complete definition of done and corresponding rules and guidelines
are found in the appendixes.

How quality is guaranteed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Standards
+++++++++

Inspired by the ISO9001 risk-based testing and the use of ASMAAI, we
defined the requirements characteristic for ISO9001. These standards,
agreements and product requirements are included in our Definition of
Done.

Defined quality
++++++++++++++++

Each requirement will be categorized into one of the following three
categories:

* Functional
* Quality
* Principle

Each functional requirement does not exist without certain quality
requirements. Therefore it can be tested using the following quality
attributes which are available in the Requirement Traceability Matrix.
The following quality attributes are defined:

* availability
* scalability
* maintainability
* accountability
* adaptability
* Integrity

If a requirement doesn’t conform to any of the above-mentioned quality
attributes it is categorized as a principle.

Testing
+++++++

Each test case will refer to the requirement being tested. The
requirements being tested use the Requirement Traceability Matrix to
verify quality attributes by the test results. In other words, if a test
case completed successfully it verifies that it complies to the quality
attribute. If a test case fails it will create a risk because the
quality standards are not met.

The test plan will be based on risk-based testing by means of TMap. TMap
NEXT is an approach to structured testing. TMap NEXT was published in
2006 and it is still the standard way of testing for many
process-oriented organizations. (tmap, sd)

Business case
-------------

This business case describes aspects such as financial benefits, project
purposes and risk assessment. It also describes what benefits weigh up
against the financial investment.

Financial Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no to little financial support because the project is defined
as low-budget. If an investment is required to realize certain
functionality, a documented substantiation must be delivered to the
client. Then, depending on the costs and possible sponsorship of the
product, the client may be able to deliver the accessories necessary.
The project group can also sponsor materials if necessary.

Benefits
~~~~~~~~

During the project, consistent documentation will be realized. A
transfer of useful and clear information to the next project group
becomes possible. Benefits are different for every stakeholder. It
mainly depends on influence and interest. A description of each
stakeholder is available which explains the interest and influence of
the specific stakeholder as seen below.

Figure : stakeholder Analysis

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Stakeholder |Financiel Benefit |other interest
|The art of robotics |Indirectly, extra publicity and promotion can
attract sponsors |Extra publicity and promotion to the ‘The Art of
Robotics’

|Projectteam |None |Professional self-development and study progress

|Windesheim |Indirectly |Winnovation promotion

|Sponsors |Indirectly |Marketing
|=======================================================================

Our team
^^^^^^^^

The project group consist of 5 students. We do not have any financial
interest, so the investment will be smaller. Personal goals have been
determined as following:

* Improve individual development process
* Facilitate study progress
* Support social contributions

The client
^^^^^^^^^^

The Art of Robotics is a foundation which goal is to promote awareness
regarding the increasing influence of robotics in everyday life. Ruud
van den Burg is our contact by ‘The Art of Robotics’. De purpose of
Willy is in line with the vision of ‘The Art of Robotics’. Willy can be
used as promotion material for ‘The Art of Robotics’. Both the influence
and the interest is high from the client.

Windesheim
^^^^^^^^^^

Windesheim is interested by the realization of ‘Willy’ because it can be
an eyecatcher during open days or Winnovation. It is also a nice
assignment during 'IT innovation' where different competencies can be
practiced.

Sponsors
^^^^^^^^

Sponsors can deliver important material that is used during the
realization of ‘Willy’. As return there will be advertisement on
'Willy'. The relevant sponsors can be shown on 'Willy’.

Potential interested stakeholders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are stakeholders who may be interested in Willy in the nearby
future. At this moment we are not doing anything with these
stakeholders, but it might be useful for next groups which will work on
the robot.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|================================================================
|Stakeholder |Financiel Benefit |other interest
|City of Zwolle |Reduced cleaning costs |Showing social interests
|RoVa |Reduced personnel costs |Innovative appearance
|McDonalds |Reduced recognizable waste |Innovative appearance
|================================================================

City of Zwolle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The city of Zwolle can use Willy against the dispersion of waste. This
will promote the city of Zwolle as an innovative city. Costs related to
cleaning companies can be reduced. This influence and the interest will
only apply when Willy is fully operational. Their interest is relatively
high, but their influence is a bit lower especially in this stage of the
project.

ROVA
^^^^

ROVA is responsible for the cleaning of the city Zwolle. Willy can clean
a specific environment and make people more aware of waste disposal.
ROVA may also be interested in Willy.

McDonalds
^^^^^^^^^

Keeping the City free of waste is also important for the McDonalds.
However the relevant area that applies to the McDonalds is smaller than
the ‘Melkmarkt’. Because waste coming from McDonalds is easily
recognizable the company might not want to be associated with local
pollution of street waste.

Keep in mind that other companies that are on the market square may also
be interested.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

The investment can be justified with the benefits. This is why the
investment must be clear. In the previous paragraph the influence and
interest are explained by the stakeholders. Willy will be improved
during this project. The only investment contains the hardware that will
be recommended or used during the project. The client will be
responsible for sponsoring or involving sponsors and if needed our team
can also recruit sponsors.

Planning
--------

Each sprint will take one week on which we will work 4 days. On day 4,
we will have a sprint review at the end of the day. During this review
we will look back on our progress we made during the sprint. After we
have confirmed everything that has been done in our sprint, we will look
at the planning for the next sprint. We make sure it is well planned in
accordance with our product owner’s wishes, see link:#scrum[3.3.1 Scrum]
for more detail on this.

5.3 Milestones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the projects main goal is to make Willy reliable and stable, new
features that will be added are not specified yet. That leaves us with
no other choice than to define a set of milestones which we could reach
during the project. This eliminates the need for a strict planning and
still show what we will achieve during the project. If we had chosen for
deadlines or achievements on set dates, it would mean those deadlines
would have been changed according to the project progress. That
diminishes the meaning of a deadline.

Also, because we use an agile approach to the project the project is
flexible because we redefine a goal and what to do each sprint. These
milestones are important to keep focused during the sprint and keeps us
focused on specific goals. These milestones are not placed in any order
because that would imply that the milestones have to be reached in a
certain way. However this is not the case with milestones. These are
simply goals that can be achieved.
