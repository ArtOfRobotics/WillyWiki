Brief reflection on learning opportunities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_Below we have devised a number of points for improvement that apply to
our group_

_*Communication*_

_Better substantiated and transferred why we did things the way we did_

_Better informing about the progress_

_*Schedule*_

_More planned work also during the sprint_

_Set a clearer goal_

_Clearer what to deliver_

_Daily stand-up every day_

_Prepare meetings_

_Divide tasks more, even during the sprint if there is more clarity_

a|

What is going well?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have made a lot of progress this week. We also gained more insight
into 'Willy' through inventory. During the customer interview we tried
to transfer this to the client.

*Jesse:*

Professional communication to stakeholders. This was mainly due to mail
contact and telephone calls this week. Made research papers about
Batteries and Screen.

*Martijn:*

Has made a contribution to the inventory of the code and the ROS
framework. Repaired flaws of Willy. Martijn has also made progress this
week to communicate information in a more nuanced manner

*Jonathan:*

Has the customer conversation professionally driven by a presentation,
this gives the course of the project more direction to our ideas.
Jonathan has also done a job on the plan of approach and scrum related
documents.

*Gerard*

Despite the illness of Gerard, he remained involved.

*Vincent*

Worked hard on the business case and Plan of approach. Also started with
researching back-up procedures.

a|
What are the bottlenecks and (possible) solutions?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'Willy' is not yet stable, and functionality is not reliable. The desire
for new functionality is high, but current functionality is being
documented and substantiated.

a|
To do next week:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is further determined at the beginning of the next sprint but we
will work on the stabilization of Willy and do research in indoor
navigation.
