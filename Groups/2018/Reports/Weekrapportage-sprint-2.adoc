Brief reflection on learning opportunities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_Below we have devised a number of points for improvement that apply to
our group_

* Better planning of what we are going to do
* Sprints of 1 week require more focus
* Having a break
* Teambuilding
* Doing a retrospective is valuable
** Also for setting certain rules or method of work
* Keeping Trello up to date
* Divide tasks more, even during the sprint if there is more clarity

a|
What is going well?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Jesse:*

Facilitate pause and productivity also a good preparation for the
knowledge lecture was resulting into a professional presentation

*Martijn:*

Martijn has made progress in communications from and between the group.
Also punctuality has noticeably improved.

*Jonathan:*

Has the customer conversation professionally driven by a presentation,
this gives the course of the project more direction to our ideas.
Jonathan has also done a job on the plan of approach and scrum related
documents.

*Gerard*

Gerard has worked according to our planning and worked with a clear
structure.

*Vincent*

Vincent gained more insight into the working of 'Willy' through a good
collaboration with Martijn.

a|
What are the bottlenecks and (possible) solutions?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The latest updates and possible choices have not yet been communicated
to the client due to the absence of the client. A new appointment is
planned next week.

a|
To do next week:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting a new sprint where goals will be defined with the product
owner.

* Indoor navigation research

During the sprint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the sprint we had many lessons which took up a lot of time, we
also did our first retrospective which was good to have. More on this
retrospective is found in the notes. (Notes Retrospective 1, 2018)

We also had a meeting planned with our client but he did not show up,
the meeting was rescheduled for the following week.

Progress
~~~~~~~~

We finished most of the items planned, but the following tasks remain
open

* Finishing inventory report
** Inventory is finished, now everything needs to be shortly documented
for later referral
* Finishing research indoor navigation
** The research has been done, but it still needs to be documented to
complete
* Backup of PC
** Is completed but lacks documentation
* Some documents like the definition of done and code requirements still
need to be finished and translated

What we have learned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Better planning of what we are going to do
* Sprints of 1 week require more focus
* Having a break
* Teambuilding
* Doing a retrospective is valuable
** Also for setting certain rules or method of work
