=== Stentor

Jesse Bouwman got in touch with a editor of the Zwolse courant de Stentor. After some email contact we planned a meeting to have an interview about Willy and the background of Willy. Joep Boerboom came and we have had some nice conversations about Willy and the future of our robot.
The article and the photo of Willy can be found on the website of de Stentor:
