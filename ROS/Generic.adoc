== ROS Introduction

=== An introduction
As a requirement from the product owner, *ROS* is used as framework on Willy. ROS, the Robot 
Operating System, is a flexible software *framework* for use in robots. It consists of a 
collection of libraries, tools and conventions that provide basic infrastructure to 
communicate between different parts of the robot.

In the case of Willy, ROS is especially handy because Willy is made with a modular design. 
All modules can be removed without disrupting the other functionalities of Willy. 
For example, when the web interface is removed, Willy is still able to drive, but 
with an other module as for example the keyboard controller. Or the removal of the motor 
driver makes Willy still able to interact with public.

=== Nodes
A *node* in ROS can be seen as a module. It is an executable that communicates through ROS 
to other nodes to send and receive data. A node can be for example a c++ application, or 
a piece of Python code, or even an Arduino connected with USB running code. A piece of 
information a node receives or sends is called a *message*.

=== Topics
A topic is a bus over which nodes can exchange data messages. A topic always has a name, 
so all topics can be identified.

To interact with a topic, two methods are used, subscribing and publishing.

==== Subscribing
Subscribing is getting data from a topic. Everytime the data in a topic is updated, a message 
will be called to all subscribing nodes. This way a node can use this information.

==== Publishing
Publishing is sending data to a topic. When a node has new information, a message will 
automatically be sent to the linked topic, so this data is updated.
