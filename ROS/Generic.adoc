== ROS Introduction

=== An introduction
As a requirement from the product owner, ROS is used as framework on Willy. ROS, the Robot 
Operating System, is a flexible software framework for use in robots. It consists of a 
collection of libraries, tools and conventions that provide basic infrastructure to 
communicate between different parts of the robot.

In the case of Willy, ROS is especially handy because Willy is made with a modular design. 
All modules can be removed without disrupting the other functionalities of Willy. 
For example, when the web interface is removed, Willy is still able to drive, but 
with an other module as for example the keyboard controller. Or the removal of the motor 
driver makes Willy still able to interact with public.
