== ROS navigation

Willy uses the ROS navigation stack to navigate inside. The ROS navigation stack is a complex collection of multiple ROS packages.
These packages reads the sensor data we provided from our sensors to create a map of the environment. 
When the user provides a goal from rviz, the global planner will provide a path to that goal and calculate the costs in that map.
costs can be compared with obstacles. The bigger the obstacle, the higher the cost.



In the image above you can see the overview of the ROS navigation stack in our project.
