=== Advice

The client walks in to Windesheim University of Applied Sciences and is being welcomed by Willy. Willy can drive autonomic inside and outside the University and makes contact to people. During a conversation Willy can recognise human emotions, so he can tell a joke to cheer people up. 

Multiple teams have worked on the projects Willy to realise that dream for the client however there is still much work to be done. 

We have described a few possible future technology projects for our client and project team in the TODO list.
