=== Automaterialenland
When the batteries were sponsored by Multibat, there were unfortunately 
no cables to connect the batteries. Then we got Automaterialenland as 
contact to provide free cables.

=== Koers Polyestertechniek
Our product owner found a company for us to create the outer plating 
with. After creating a foam mold, we drove it to Koers in Nieuwleusen 
and made the outer skin of Willy from fiberglass.
