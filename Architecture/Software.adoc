== Software Architecture

=== Standpoints

The software architecture needs to be compartmented for development puproses. To make sure the development doesn't compromise the system as a whole the following standpoints are defined to fortify the design.
 
* Each seperate function gets a separate repository
* Each seperate function has no dependency to another
* The GiT proces is applied for every repository
* Every function is running hardware independant
* Every function is running OS independant


=== Design

Embedding these standpoints into the Robotic Operating System (ROS) resulted in the following architure design.

=== ROS Master

A key feature of ROS is the topic communication. By separation of each function the ROS master, which facilitates the topics, is the key component. Every function communicate according a topic and therefore ROS master functions as a servicebus for each current and future feature. 

[NOTE]
Designing this architecture and keeping it up to date can be done by importing/edditing the xml files in https://www.draw.io/. 
Draw.io is free of charge to use and requires no client.
