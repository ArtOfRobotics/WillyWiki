The Speech topic describes the ability of Willy to audily communicate with human beings. 
It is part of the social interaction, but due to the necessity of the variious components it seemed
best to describe it as a separate topic in this WiKi.

The start_speech.sh script exists because it is the most convenient way to launch the python scripts.
In total two python scripts will be launched:
* Say.py
* Observer.py
